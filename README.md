# Truss Design and Analysis using STAAD Pro

# Overview</br>
This project involves the design and analysis of a truss structure using STAAD Pro, focusing on optimizing load distribution and ensuring structural stability. The truss was modeled with various support types, including roller, fixed, and pinned, to determine their impact on the overall structural performance. The resulting design is a robust truss system capable of withstanding calculated loads efficiently.</br>
